# PRACTICE PROBLEM 1

# fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "banana")

# print(fruits.count('banana'))

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 2

# the length of the set is 5 because sets have unique elements

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 3

# a = {1, 2, 3, 4}    
# b = {3, 4, 5, 6}
# c = a.union(b)

# print(c)

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 4

# correct

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 5

}

# sum_of_ages = 0
# for age in ages.values():
#     sum_of_ages += age
# print(sum_of_ages)

# print(sum(ages.values()))

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 6

# print(min(ages.values()))

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 7

# a one-element list will be printed: ['bear']

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 8 - could use different method

# statement = "The Flintstones Rock"
# statement = statement.replace(" ", "")

# frequency_dict = {}
# for char in statement:
#     frequency_dict[char] = frequency_dict.get(char, 0) + 1
# print(frequency_dict)

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 9

# return value will be a list: [2, 3]

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 10 -> wrong

# will print ('b', 'bear')

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 11

# the return value will be [1, 2]

# PRACTICE PROBLEM 12 -> wrong

# output will be an attribute error because frozensets
# are immutable
